## 📁 Project Structure

| Section | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Section 1 – Data Collection** | Collected launch data from SpaceX REST API and stored it in CSV format. |
| **Section 2 – Data Wrangling** | Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis using pandas and NumPy. |
| **Section 3 – EDA & Visualization** | Conducted exploratory data analysis and plotted visual trends. |
| **Section 4 – Interactive Dashboard** | Created a Dash dashboard to visualize launch outcomes interactively. |
| **Section 5 – Folium Mapping** | Used Folium maps to display launch sites, proximities, and outcomes. |
| **Section 6 – Machine Learning** | Trained multiple classification models to predict launch success. |

## 📈 Results and Conclusion

1. Decision Tree performed best for launch prediction.  
2. Launch success is influenced by payload mass and site location.  
3. Visual analysis improved understanding of launch behavior.  
4. The Folium map effectively showed geographic factors in launch outcomes.  
5. The project demonstrates full-cycle data analysis — from data collection to model deployment.
